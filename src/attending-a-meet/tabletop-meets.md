Tabletop meets are special mini-sized meets that focus on all things tabletop gaming. All things relating to trading card games, roleplaying games, wargaming, and board games are welcome, and it's a great way of meeting furries in a quieter, more structured environment.

## The games

A variety of games will be available for free play, from casual games like Uno to cult classics like Ticket to Ride. Dungeons & Dragons and Warhammer may also be available, conditional on availability.

If you're not a seasoned tabletop gamer, most games will have someone available to explain the rules and help you learn how to play.

Feel free to bring:

- Board games
- Card games
- Trading card game decks
- Wargaming and TTRPG miniatures
- Handheld games consoles (however, you are not allowed to charge these at Excelsior)

Please don't bring:

- Games with explicit themes or content
- Beyblades, Bakugan, or other 'battle' games
- Large electronics

## Differences from furmeets

Tabletop meets still let you hang out with your fellow furries, but there are a few differences:

- Tabletop meets are smaller and centred around a particular social activity. If you're not planning to play games, this isn't for you.
- Fursuiting, including the wearing of tails, is not allowed. Other furry accessories are fine, however.
- Alcohol is strictly forbidden inside of the venue.

Different people organise the tabletop meets than the regular furmeets, though some BristolFurs staff members will typically be present.
