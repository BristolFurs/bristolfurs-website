{% faq "Do I need to register to turn up to the meet?" %}
Nothing to do, just turn up! Although we'd love to know you're coming! Let us know on Twitter, Facebook, or join the Telegram and Discord!
{% endfaq %}

{% faq "Is there an entry fee?" %}
No entry fee! If you wish to support BristolFurs with more than just your prescense, support the venue by buying drinks (Drink responsibly!), or we take donations at the meet.
{% endfaq %}

{% faq "Do I need a fursuit to attend?" %}
You don't need a fursuit to be a furry, or to attend BristolFurs meets. They are welcome and encouraged with the fursuit walks, but there's plenty of other things to do!
{% endfaq %}

{% faq "How old do I need to be to attend?" %}
You must be 18 years of age or older to attend BristolFurs.

{% faq "Can I bring my children to the meet?" %}
If your child is 12 or older they can come, but you will be responsible for their actions and expected to supervise at all times. We cannot allow children under 12 to attend.
{% endfaq %}

{% faq "Can I hug the fursuiters?" %}

{% faq "Can I take pictures at the meet?" %}
At times fursuiters may be posing in groups for photos, feel free to take photos here! If you're wanting to take photos or record individuals or smaller groups please ask first. If someone asks you to delete or remove a photo with them in, please respect their wishes.
{% endfaq %}

{% faq "I haven't gone to a meet before and I don't know anyone! What should I do?" %}
We run a pre-meet at Starbucks Temple Quay from 11am. This tends to be a little more relaxed with fewer people to get talking before we walk to the main meet at 1pm!
{% endfaq %}

{% faq "Can I bring my own food?" %}
Yes, our current venue is situated next to St Nick's Market so there's plenty of nearby food choices. If you bring any food please dispose of waste.
{% endfaq %}

{% faq "Can I bring my own drinks?" %}
Our venue is a bar and we ask you to support them by purchasing drinks. Soft drinks are available for non-drinkers. Bottles of water are allowed to be brought, and outside soft drinks are ONLY allowed during the fursuit walk (away from the venue).

**ALCOHOL BOUGHT OUTSIDE OF THE VENUE IS NOT ALLOWED AT ANY TIME.**
{% endfaq %}

{% faq "Can I bring X board or card game for people to play?" %}
We have limited table space but if there is room, feel free! Our venue also has a supply of board and card games downstairs which you may use. We generally have a Nintendo Switch set up with the projector during the meet and we encourage you to bring your own handhelds!
