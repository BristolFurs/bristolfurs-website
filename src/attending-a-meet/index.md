## Before you attend

Make sure you've read the [code of conduct]({{ '/code-of-conduct/' | url }})! Ignorance is no excuse for rulebreaking.

You must be 18 years old to attend the meets. You may be asked to present identification if we suspect you're younger than this.

You'll probably want to familiarise yourself with how to get to and from our venues: [The Boardroom]({{ '/venue-information/the-boardroom/' }}) and [Starbucks Temple Quay]({{ '/venue-information/starbucks-temple-quay/' | url }}). Make sure you can get home after the meet!

If you have any questions, check our [frequently asked questions page]({{ '/attending-a-meet/faqs/' | url }}). If that hasn't covered it, you can [contact us]({{ '/contact-us/' | url }}) and we'll try to give you an answer.

## The pre-meet

The pre-meet takes place from 11am until 12:45pm at [Starbucks Temple Quay]({{ '/venue-information/starbucks-temple-quay/' | url }}), near Bristol Temple Meads railway station (not the one inside).

The pre-meet is a casual, low-pressure hangout mainly for people travelling into the city for the meet or those new to the meets. If it's your first BristolFurs meet, it's a great place to break the ice with a smaller group over a cup of coffee.

We normally congregate upstairs around the large table, we may be a bit more spread out depending on numbers and table availability.

We normally leave around 12:45pm to walk to the main venue as a group.

## The furmeet

The main event starts at 1pm at [The Boardroom]({{ '/venue-information/the-boardroom/' }}) and consists of a mostly unstructured hangout space for you to get socialising with other local furs.

Stop by the bar for some social lubricant in the form of drinks or even a board game (but please be considerate in terms of table space.)

The meet ends at 6pm, though you are free to stay around longer.

## The fursuit walk

The [fursuit walk]({{ '/attending-a-meet/fursuit-walk/' | url }}) starts at 3pm and takes roughly an hour. We ask that fursuiters intending to join the walk be dressed and outside The Boardroom by 2:45pm.

The fursuit walk may be cancelled or delayed due to inclement weather. (Because nothing smells worse than wet fur.) We try to give advance notice if the walk is unlikely to take place.

See our guide on [fursuiting at BristolFurs meets]({{ '/attending-a-meet/fursuiting/' | url }}) for full details of the fursuit walk and changing facilities.

## After the meet

Had a good time? Consider joining one of our online social groups to keep those conversations going!

Any lost property will be held by BristolFurs staff, rather than the venue. We'll normally post about any found property on our Discord, or you can [contact the staff]({{ '/contact-us/' | url }}) if you've misplaced anything.
