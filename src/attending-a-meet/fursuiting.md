Fursuits are awesome, and we encourage you to fursuit at BristolFurs meets. There's just a few things you outta know...

## The fursuit walk

We aim to do a fursuit walk around the centre of Bristol at every meet. This walk is in public spaces, guided by meet staff and volunteers wearing hi-vis vests in a snazzy purple.

The walk starts around 3pm and takes about an hour. Fursuiters are expected to be ready and outside of the venue 15 minutes prior to the walk beginning.

If we are unable to hold a walk for some reason, such as due to wet weather, fursuiters are still encouraged to suit up within the venue.

### Walking routes

The walking route will usually change depending on the weather. The route of the walks are subject to change as required.

#### Queen Square route (dry conditions)

This route is typically used in dry and hot weather. It provides more open space and greenery with plentiful shaded areas. It's a shorter route, but includes walking on gravel and grass surfaces.

The walk leads down St Nicholas Street and Clare Street, following Broad Quay southwards until the junction of Prince Street and King Street. We then cross over onto Queen Square, where we stop for a break, public schenanigans, and a group photoshoot.

We return to the Boardroom via Welsh Back and High Street.

#### Millennium Square route (wet conditions)

This route is commonly used when it has recently rained and the ground is still damp or drying. The entire walking route is paved.

The walk leads down St Nicholas Street and Clare Street, through The Centre onto Anchor Road and past the outside of We The Curious, stopping at Millennium Square for a break and public schenanigans.

We will sometimes proceed to the Lloyds Amphitheatre for a photoshoot, depending on conditions.

Afterwards, we return via Pero's Bridge and Narrow Quay, before rejoining the fountains and heading back to The Boardroom on the same route as before.

### Fursuit walk rules

When on the walk, please follow the following additional rules:

- Always follow the instructions given by the meet staff and volunteer stewards, particularly when crossing roads and bicycle lanes.
- Do not walk ahead of the lead steward or behind the trailing steward, unless doing so to take photographs.
- Do not consume alcohol at any time during the walk. Bristol bylaws prohibit street drinking.
- Do not play music when walking. You may do so at the stopping locations.

## Storage and changing space

Be aware that there is limited space for storage and changing at The Boardroom.

A small side room is available for changing. You must use this room if you need to remove any items of regular clothing in order to put on or take off your fursuit.

Partial suits that don't require removing clothes can be changed into in the main room or in the toilet.

Travel cases and other large bags can be stored on and under the signposted table at the top of the stairs or on the tables in the changing room.

**All items are stored at the owners own risk.**

## General guidance

- **Take regular breaks.** Don't hesitate to remove the fursuit head or other accessories if necessary.
- **Stay hydrated.** Suiting is hot work! Drink lots of water or isotonic drinks both whilst fursuiting and for an hour afterwards.
- **Be aware of your appendages.** Tails, wings and other accessories are brilliant makeshift weapons for hitting people and things. Try to avoid doing that.
- **Recognise the signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke.** Be aware of headaches, dizziness, nausea, muscle cramps and an elevated heart rate. If you're struggling with any of them, seek immediate assistance and alert a walk volunteer.
