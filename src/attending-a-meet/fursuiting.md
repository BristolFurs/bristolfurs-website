Fursuits are awesome, and we encourage you to fursuit at BristolFurs meets. There's just a few things you outta know...

## The fursuit walk

We aim to do a fursuit walk around the centre of Bristol at every meet, starting around 3pm and taking about an hour.

[See the fursuit walk page]({{ '/attending-a-meet/fursuit-walk/' | url }}) for information on the routes and rules of the walk.

## General guidance

- **Take regular breaks.** Don't hesitate to remove the fursuit head or other accessories if necessary.
- **Stay hydrated.** Suiting is hot work! Drink lots of water or isotonic drinks both whilst fursuiting and for an hour afterwards.
- **Be aware of your appendages.** Tails, wings and other accessories are brilliant makeshift weapons for hitting people and things. Try to avoid doing that.
- **Recognise the signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke.** Be aware of headaches, dizziness, nausea, muscle cramps and an elevated heart rate. If you're struggling with any of them, seek immediate assistance and alert a walk volunteer.
