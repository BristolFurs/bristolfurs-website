lede: Become a BristolFurs Supporter to help fund equipment and operating costs.

Turns out that herding cats (and dogs, wolves, foxes, protogen, etc.) takes a bit of time and money.

## Become a supporter

## What your support pays for

100% of donations made to BristolFurs go back into improving the meets. All of the meets staff volunteer their time and aren't compensated in any way.

Currently, we use donations to cover:

- equipment for fursuit walks, like walkie-talkies and hi-vis
- equipment at the venue, like bins(?)
- maintaining our website and online services
- small expenses, such as printing signage around the venue

In future we want to:

- consider different meet venues that are better for fursuiting and accessibility, but may come with hiring fees
