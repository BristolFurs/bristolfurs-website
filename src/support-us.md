lede: Become a BristolFurs Supporter to help fund equipment and operating costs.

Turns out that herding cats (and dogs, wolves, foxes, protogen, etc.) takes a bit of time and money.

## Become a supporter

We accept both recurring and one-off donations via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/bristolfurs). Recurring Ko-Fi supporters will receive a supporter lanyard at their next meet.

We receive 100% of any one-off donations sent via Ko-Fiâ€”they don't take a cut. Recurring payments incur a small fee of approximately 5%.

Cash donations are also accepted in-person at the meets.

## What your support pays for

100% of the donations received by BristolFurs goes back into improving the meets. All of the meets staff volunteer their time and aren't compensated in any way.

Currently, we use donations to cover:

- equipment for fursuit walks, like walkie-talkies and hi-vis
- equipment not provided by the venue
- maintaining our website and online services
- small expenses, such as printing signage around the venue
- manufacturing rewards for our recurring supporters

In future we want to:

- Consider the possibility of new merch for attendees to have nice stuff to take home, and to provide additional revenue for improving the meets further
- consider different meet venues that are better for fursuiting and accessibility, but may come with hiring fees, new equipment requirements, or other costs
