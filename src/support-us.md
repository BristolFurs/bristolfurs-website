lede: Become a BristolFurs Supporter to help fund equipment and operating costs.

Turns out that herding cats (and dogs, wolves, foxes, protogen, etc.) takes a bit of time and money.

## Become a supporter

## What your support pays for

100% of donations made to BristolFurs go back into improving the meets. All of the meets staff volunteer their time and aren't compensated in any way.

Currently, we use donations to cover:

- equipment for fursuit walks, like walkie-talkies and hi-vis
- equipment not provided by the venue
- maintaining our website and online services
- small expenses, such as printing signage around the venue
- manufacturing rewards for our recurring supporters

In future we want to:

- consider different meet venues that are better for fursuiting and accessibility, but may come with hiring fees, new equipment requirements, or other costs
