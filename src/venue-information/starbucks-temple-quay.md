Starbucks at Temple Quay is where have our pre-meet.

Located just around the corner from Bristol Temple Meads railway station, it's a convenient spot for any out-of-towners to grab a drink and a seat before heading onward to our main venue together.

It also provides a quieter and more relaxed experience for anyone who prefers to get to know people ahead of time.

Please note: This is **not** the same Starbucks as the one inside of Temple Meads railway station.

## Fursuiting

Do not fursuit at a Starbucks. Just don't.

## Accessibility

### Mobility

We usually meet in the upstairs section of this Starbucks, but unfortunately, it is not wheelchair accessible. If you use a wheelchair and intend to come, please inform us in advance, and we will make arrangements to gather downstairs or outside instead.

The doors of this Starbucks have a split design, which may pose difficulties for wheelchair users. There is a call button on the outside of the door for those who need assistance.

### Toilets

Single-occupancy gendered toilets are located at the rear of the upper floor. [Does it need a code?]

A wheelchair accessible toilet is available on the ground floor. [Does it need a code/RADAR key?]
