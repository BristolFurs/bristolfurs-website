A cosy bar lifted straight out of the 1980s, [the Colosseum](https://www.colosseumbristol.co.uk/) has been recently reinvented for the 21st century, now serving cocktails and tapas close to the centre of Bristol's Harbourside.

We have exclusive use of the Colosseum until 4pm. Outside food and drinks are not permitted in the Colosseum.

{% call warning() %}
Do not leave any belongings unattended after 4pm.

## Accessibility

### Mobility

The Colosseum is located on top of a small hill, so some of the surrounding paths may be steep. There is a single step up from the pavement to the main entrance of the Colosseum.

There is completely step-free access available by going via the terrace and through the side entrance, however, this is not always open. Please catch the attention of a member of meet or venue staff if the gate or terrace door is not accessible.

### Toilets

Male toilets and a combined disabled and gender neutral toilet are located on the ground floor. Female toilets are located upstairs.

## Travel

### By train

The nearest railway station is [Bristol Temple Meads](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/bristol-temple-meads/) (approximately 0.5 miles away from the Colosseum).

If arriving by train, you may be interested in [the pre-meet that takes place near the station]({{ '/venue-information/starbucks-temple-quay/' | url }}).

### By bus

The Colosseum is located in near to Bristol's Harbourside area, with the nearest major interchanges being St Mary Redcliffe and Queen Square. Use [the First Bus website](https://www.firstgroup.com/bristol-bath-and-west/) to find the best route for you.

### By car or motorbike

The nearest car park is the [Redcliffe Parade car park](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/residents/parking/where-to-park-in-bristol/redcliffe-parade-long-stay-car-park) just behind The Colosseum. The larger [Portwall Lane car park](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/residents/parking/where-to-park-in-bristol/portwall-lane-long-stay-car-park) is also only a few minutes walk away.

### By bike

The nearest bicycle parking is four on-street bike racks located across the road from the Colosseum, next to St Mary Redcliffe Church.

A number of other on-street bike racks are located further down Redcliffe Hill, as well as in Portwall Lane car park.
