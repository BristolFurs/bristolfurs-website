{% from "../_includes/components/warning.njk" import warning %}

A cosy bar lifted straight out of the 1980s, [the Colosseum](https://www.colosseumbristol.co.uk/) has been recently reinvented for the 21st century, now serving cocktails and tapas close to the centre of Bristol's Harbourside.

Outside food and drinks (except for bottled water) are not permitted in the Colosseum.

{% call warning() %}
We share the Colosseum with members of the public. Do not leave any belongings unattended. Neither we nor the Colosseum are not responsible for loss or theft.

## Fursuiting

There are no dedicated fursuit changing or storage facilities available at the Colosseum. You may use the toilets to change, but be aware that they may be cramped and wet.

## Accessibility

### Mobility

The Colosseum is located on top of a small hill, so some of the surrounding paths may be steep. There is a single step up from the pavement to the main entrance of the Colosseum.

There is completely step-free access available by going via the terrace and through the side entrance, however, this is not always open. Please catch the attention of a member of meet or venue staff if the gate or terrace door is not accessible.

### Toilets

Male toilets and a combined disabled and gender neutral toilet are located on the ground floor. Female toilets are located upstairs.

## Travel

### By train

The nearest railway station is [Bristol Temple Meads](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/bristol-temple-meads/) (approximately 0.5 miles away from the Colosseum).

The nearest car park is the [Redcliffe Parade car park](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/residents/parking/where-to-park-in-bristol/redcliffe-parade-long-stay-car-park) just behind The Colosseum.

### By bike

The nearest bicycle parking is four on-street bike racks located across the road from the Colosseum, next to St Mary Redcliffe Church.

A number of other on-street bike racks are located further down Redcliffe Hill, as well as in Portwall Lane car park.
