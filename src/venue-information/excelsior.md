{% from "../_includes/components/warning.njk" import warning %}

Bristol's largest independent comic book and tabletop gaming store has recently relocated to Broadmead, with a massive and shiny new store to boot.

We use Excelsior for our gaming mini-meets, which take place on sporadic Sundays. Join our [Discord]({{ siteMetadata.discordLink }}) or [Telegram]({{ siteMetadata.telegramLink }}) groups for information on upcoming mini-meets.

Outside drinks (except for bottled water) are not allowed at Excelsior and alcohol is strictly forbidden.

## Fursuiting

Fursuiting and furry accessories (like tails) are not permitted at Excelsior meets.

## Travel

### By train

The nearest railway station is Bristol Temple Meads. From there, you can walk (approximately 15 minutes) or take the number 8 bus from directly outside of the station entrance to Haymarket.

### By bus

Excelsior is located in Broadmead, in the centre of Bristol's shopping area. Most buses pass through or close to Broadmead, and Bristol Bus Station is located next to the area. Use [the First Bus website](https://www.firstgroup.com/bristol-bath-and-west/) to find the best route for you.

### By car or motorbike

Broadmead is a largely pedestrianised area, and parking is very limited. It's better to use public transport if possible.

Otherwise, the nearest major car parks are [Cabot Circus](https://www.cabotcircus.com/parking/cabot-circus-multi-storey-car-park), [The Galleries](https://www.galleriesbristol.co.uk/parking/), and [NCP Bristol Broadmead](https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/bristol-broadmead/). Cabot Circus car park is outside of Bristol's Clean Air Zone, provided you enter and exit from the eastern side of it.

Blue badge holders can park on-street within Broadmead.

### By bike

There are several staple-style bicycle racks located on the street outside of Excelsior and nearby in other areas of Broadmead.

Be aware that theft of bikes and cycle parks is fairly common in Broadmead, so ensure that bicycles are well secured.
