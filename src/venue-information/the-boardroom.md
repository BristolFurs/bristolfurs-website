The Boardroom is our current home away from home. Although cosy, cushy couches and welcoming staff have welcomed us back every month since 2019!

Please note: Outside drinks are not allowed in The Boardroom, except for water. Any drinks purchased from venues other than The Boardoom must be drank outside. Outside food is permitted in the venue.

## Fursuiting

We have a small room available as a changing room adjoining the function room. This is not on the ground floor of The Boardroom, so be aware that you will need to traverse the stairs in suit if you're participating in the fursuit walk.

The changing room has a small amount of storage space for suitcases available. Additional storage space is present in the main function room, next to the stairs.

See [our full guide on fursuiting at our meets]({{ '/attending-a-meet/fursuiting/' | url }}).

## Accessibility

### Mobility

The Boardroom’s function room is up two flights of stairs and is not accessible to wheelchairs. People with mobility or stability issues may also find ascending the stairs difficult, as there is no handrail.

There are small steps from pavement level to enter the ground floor of the venue. Furmeet attendees are free to utilise the ground floor and outside areas of the venue at any time, but be aware that members of the public will also be in these spaces.

### Toilets

A single occupancy unisex toilet is located next to the upstairs function room.

Gender segregated toilets are located on the basement level of the venue.

There are no wheelchair accessible toilets in any part of the venue.
