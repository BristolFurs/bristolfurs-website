  description: Accessibility statement for the bristolfurs.co.uk website.
---

This accessibility statement applies to the BristolFurs website hosted at bristolfurs.co.uk. It does not include the furmeets themselves, any subdomains of the bristolfurs.co.uk domain, nor any BristolFurs presence on third-party websites or services.

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- Change colours, contrast levels and fonts using your browser or device settings.
- Zoom in up to 400% without needing to horizontally scroll to view text.
- Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard, mouse or speech recognition software.
- Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Compliance status

The website is fully compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), level AA standard.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Content not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

Some pages feature content embedded from Google Maps and Ko-fi. Whilst we've tried to ensure these embeds are accessible, as this is content embedded from a third-party, we are unable to guarantee that it is accessible to all users.

### Other accessibility concerns

These issues do not constitute a failure under WCAG 2.2 Level AA criteria, however may still represent a degraded experience or accessibility barrier to users.

- The site header and page headers lack borders in forced colour modes, making the boundary between them and subsequent content difficult to see in forced colour modes.
- The back link arrows on some pages are not visible in forced colour modes. The links themselves remain visible.

## Feedback and contact information

If you find any problems not listed on this page, you can [open an issue in the website's repository on GitHub](https://github.com/BristolFurs/bristolfurs-website/issues) or [contact us directly]({{ '/contact-us/' | url }}).

We will endeavour to review your request and to respond as quickly as possible.
