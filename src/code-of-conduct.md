title: BristolFurs code of conduct
---

**Please read this document thoroughly before attending any BristolFurs events. BristolFurs will not consider a claimed lack of knowledge of the rules as an excuse for breaking them under any circumstances.**

This document lays out the conditions of attendance between you (the attendee) and the BristolFurs community and management team (BristolFurs) and acts as a code of conduct for all who attend our events.

The attendee is bound by this agreement in its entirety when they attend any event hosted by BristolFurs or engage with Bristolfurs’ online spaces. For ease of readability only, terms have been separated into In-person and online.

This code of conduct is subject to change at any time without notice. Please review this document regularly and note any changes.
